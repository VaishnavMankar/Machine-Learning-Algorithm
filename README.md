# Machine Learning Algorithms 📘

This repository is a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented both **from scratch** and using **scikit-learn**.  
It was created during my second semester while learning the fundamentals of machine learning, with the goal of understanding the mathematical foundations and practical applications of each algorithm.
